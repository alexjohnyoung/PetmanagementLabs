# Pet Management System with GraphQL - Manual Implementation

This project is a pet management system that uses **GraphQL** with **Spring Boot** to manage households and pets, implemented to demonstrate understanding of the technology stack.

## Features
- Retrieve all households and their pets.
- Get details of a household by its Eircode.
- Fetch statistics about households and pets.
- Add new households.
- Delete households by Eircode.
- Get and delete pets by their ID.

## How the Project Was Built
This project was developed to learn and demonstrate the implementation of:
- **Spring Boot** for backend development.
- **H2 in-memory database** for testing purposes.
- **GraphQL Query and Mutation resolvers** for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** for clean data handling.
- **Jakarta Validation** for enforcing validation rules on input data, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code, such as getters, setters, and constructors, simplifying class definitions.
